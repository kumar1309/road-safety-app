#problem statement 
Chennai faces critical road safety challenges, such as frequent accidents at hotspots like Mount Road and Anna Salai, severe congestion in areas like T. Nagar and Koyambedu during peak hours, delayed emergency response times, and inadequate pedestrian infrastructure. The lack of proper cyclist safety measures, unreported hazards like waterlogged roads during monsoons, and inefficient parking management worsen the city's road safety issues.
Chennai road safety issues include:
Accident Hotspots: Over 25 high-risk zones like Mount Road and Kathipara Junction record frequent accidents, with up to 50 incidents annually in some areas.
Traffic Congestion: Peak hour delays in Koyambedu and T. Nagar slow traffic to below 10 km/h, causing long commute times and pollution.
Pedestrian Risks: 30% of road fatalities involve pedestrians and cyclists due to inadequate infrastructure in areas like Parry's Corner and Velachery Main Road.
#solutions 
Smart Navigation System: Provides the shortest path, predicts traffic congestion and accident hotspots, and offers road alerts with voice and read features.
AI Chatbot Guide: Acts as a navigation assistant, offers location-based suggestions, replies with voice/read features, and customizes recommendations using the userâ€™s current location.
Parking Recommendation: Suggests nearby parking zones, enables pre-booking, and provides a separate portal for parking authorities to manage bookings.
Accident Detection: Utilizes AI/ML models with CCTV to detect collisions and notify relevant authorities in real-time.
Emergency & Community Alerts: Allows users to press an emergency button when feeling unsafe during travel or to report hazards like flooding or potholes. Authorities can respond promptly through a dedicated management system.
Gamified Awareness: Promotes safety awareness via games, rewards users with redeemable points for services (e.g., parking, car washes, fuel), and awards points for community reporting.
Wearable Device Alerts: Monitors driver vitals (e.g., heart rate) through wearable devices, detects anomalies, and issues real-time safety alerts.
